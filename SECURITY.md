Include as much of the following as possible:

- Affected module(s) and versions/branches
- Steps to reproduce / proof of concept
- Impact assessment
- Any suggested fix or mitigation

## Response Timeline

We aim to:

- acknowledge within **2 business days**
- provide an initial assessment within **7 business days**
- publish a fix as soon as reasonably possible, depending on severity and
  complexity

## Coordinated Disclosure

We follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
Please allow a reasonable time window for investigation and remediation before
public disclosure.

We support the responsible publication of vulnerability even beyond the actual
remediation. This may include - especially in the context of open-source
projects - technical exchanges and the provision of background information for
conferences, publications or presentations, provided that these serve to improve
security. We expressly welcome prior consultation in this regard.
